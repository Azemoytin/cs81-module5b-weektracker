# Reflection

Were your predictions accurate?

Yes, my guesses were accurate because 
top enjoyment was Team Practice, Main category as expected was physical activities, and Time-of-day trend was correct by having the mornings physical and afternoons more social.

What surprised you about your week?

I didnâ€™t expect Reading on Thursday to be so enjoyable given it was shorter than my other activities.

Which higher-order function was most useful and why?

The .reduce() function was the most useful high-order function because I used it to calculate average enjoyment by time of day in averageEnjoymentByTimeOfDay and count categories in mostCommonCategory. It was able to both summarize and transform my data making it extremely useful.
