# Reflection

Were your predictions accurate?

Yes, my guesses were accurate
Top enjoyment: I thought Team Practice would be the most enjoyable, and it was.
Main category: I expected physical activities to appear most often, and they did for 3 out of the 7 days
Time-of-day trend: I predicted mornings would be physical and afternoons more social. That’s exactly what the data showed.

What surprised you about your week?

I didn’t expect Reading on Thursday to be so enjoyable given it was shorter than my other activities.

Which higher-order function was most useful and why?

The .reduce() function was the most useful high-order function because I used it to calculate average enjoyment by time of day in averageEnjoymentByTimeOfDay and count categories in mostCommonCategory. It was able to both summarize and transform my data making it extremely useful.
